    <h1> Hometown and school</h1>

      <p> I attend lawndale high school I am an incoming junior i’m in Avid. I've always lived in the same house in Lawndale at times I do want to move but I can't leave my house with all my memories.<br>
    <h1> A little bit about me</h1>
      <p> On my free time I usually babysit and on rare occasions I go out on some adventures with my friends or my cousins.I also take long walks with my nephew or go to dinner with my friend Jasmin or my best friend Alex.
  My  family and I are really close were always around each other, it gets annoying at times.
  I have a twin sister we do NOT get along as strange as that sounds but we just don’t get along. We are two complete different people and do not see eye to eye.
  I have three older brothers and an older sister. I also have 2 nephews and 4 nieces, I completely love my nieces and nephews but a nephew of mine stands out his name is Isaac we have the closest bond he is my baby I completely love him. I love all my other babies but I just love him a little bit more.
  I have three dogs honestly i’ve gotten over my dogs i like them but I wouldn’t get dogs when i move out.
  My favorite tv shows are Grey’s anatomy and 90 day fiance. My all time favorite movies are home alone and hací.</p>

<h3> Things I do not like!</h3>
  <p> I do NOT like insects not one bit. I'm so terrified of any type of insctes especially spiders. I'm scared of cats, rats, and snakes. I'm scared of them cause they're so sneaky and they attack you out the no where. But rats and snakes are so nasty ew!
<h4> Favorite Animal</h3>
  <p> My favortive animal is an elephant and a giraffe. I really do not have a reason why these two animals are my favorite animals, I know that an elephant is a sign of protection, a blessing on your future, and fotune. I'm not sure what kind of energy a giraffe has but I just find them so especially when they're babies.
